\begin{itemize}
    \item \alert{Application-specific requirements:} run only on specific versions of an OS with a specific patch level. 
    \item \alert{Application conflict:}  incompatible with each other.
    \item \alert{Resource contention:} A heavily-used application cannot crowd out other applications
    \item \alert{Resilience:} crashes won't bring down other applications.
    \item \alert{Maintenance:} upgrade and reboot one system without affecting others.
\end{itemize}
